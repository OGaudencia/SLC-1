  <h3>Development solutions to peers and supervisor</h3>
  <h2><center>Presentation of Hot Wheels website </h2>
  <p>This Presentation was in Programming Fundamentals II with Chris Fulton as the lecturer. The Hot Wheel was a website based on cars and my team and I chose it because we were all interested in cars and speed.
    We decided to come up with the topmost expensive cars and the cars that weighted the most out of 100 cars in our lists. JavaScript was the main language in the assignment. It was my first time to try to use JavaScript as the programming language in any code that I wrote.  
    I was a little hesitant with the particular group project but anyway I gave it a go. However, as the project went and we took the learning step by step as we made the website. Never thought I will pull it off this smoothly however, I came up with the code that I researched from different sources around the web. I am still proud today of the work my team and myself did and the code that I came up with that I got to work with no prior knowledge of it.
    I learned through patience, interest and cooperative, one can learn any programming language. Teamwork is also important in a group project as some other members of a group dealt with the design. Without them, I could but would have struggled to put all the pieces and information together.

   <h2><center>Presentation on of a website made with photo Shop </center></h2>
  <p>The presentation happened in Timmreck Gerald's class, PhotoShop. For a start, when I was instructed to make a website with no coding but only with photoShop that made me curious. The aim of the project was transforming “a bad website” that you picked online and make it better, presenting the before and after picture to get comments from classmates and teacher before final submission. 
  For a person who prefers to make a website through code I would not want to snip things and make them the right size or spend an hour brushing on an object for the desired output. Easier to throw a margin or padding that will take seconds. 
  However, being positive and thoughtful was the way forward. Amazingly, it was fun, simple, and easy and I did enjoy it. The setback of this project was time-consuming. I can do photoshop in the future even if needed.
