  <h3>Database Properly structure</h3>
  <h2><center>Creation of database MyRobot</center></h2>
  <p>This was in our database server class with Paula Merns as the instructor. For this assignment, I created a database diagram named MyRobotButlerJeeves using MySQL Server Management Studio. 
	The database I created included three tables, which were Butler customer, Butler and Butler schedule. Through the database and tables, I was able to make a relational database diagram. It was a challenging class and needed my attention to understand the entire process. 
	Over the course of the class, I learned a lot about the structuring of a database and how to properly tie them together with primary and foreign keys. If you ask me, it is important to learn databases because with our profession we will have to deal with databases on a daily bases. It is important to know how to work in them and understand how they are structured.
	While this is initially not part of my strengths, but after having this course I feel comfortable and more confident with databases.

   <h2>Creating of backup to a library database</h2>
  <p>This was also in the Database server class with Paula as the instructor. We needed to setup an automatic script to backup the database. This was something new that I learned, as I have never work with an automatic script before.
	In real life, everything needs a backup just in case. We never know what happens next so better safe than sorry. We made a backup a Library database using an SQL statement to determine the time and size it will consume. Then we made a script to do it and set it to run every day at 10am.
	This is important because our data is in and of itself important to us and we want to be able to recover in case of losing data from corruption or accidents. This is very important to companies of all sizes their data is also their money and no one wants to lose money or their job because of a simple mistake.  I enjoyed this process because it was something new and it was exciting to see an automatic script at work.
